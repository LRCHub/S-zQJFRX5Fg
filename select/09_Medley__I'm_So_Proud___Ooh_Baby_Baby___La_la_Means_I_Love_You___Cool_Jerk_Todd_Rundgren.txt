You're prettier than all the world
And I'm so proud, I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you
'Cause you're only one fellow's girl
I'm so proud, I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know,
If you ever were untrue, yeah
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yeah, and I'm so proud, I'm so proud,
I'm so proud of you
Compliments to you from all the people we meet
Yes babe and I'm so proud, I'm so proud,
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you

I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
I'm crying - ooh baby, baby

Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too
I'm crying - ooh, baby, baby

I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop trying
I can't give up hope

'Cause I believe
One day I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
I'm crying - ooh baby, baby

Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And then you pass them by
Now you're in the center ring
And their lies don't mean a thing
Why won't you let me try
Now I don't have a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is La La means
I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me
Let me take you in my arms
And fill you with my charms
I'm sure that you will see
The things I am saying are true
And the way that I say them to you
Can't you hear me, La La means
I love you

Cool jerk, cool jerk, cool jerk, cool jerk
This cat they're talking about
I wonder who could it be
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat
The heaviest cat you ever did see
When you see me walking down the street
And they clapping and they speak
All the business they wish to whisper it
But they know I'm the king of the cool jerks
Ah ha ha
Look at them guys looking at me like I'm a fool
Ah but deep down inside they know I'm cool
I said now,
I said now the moment of truth has finally come
When I was gonna do some, some of that cool jerk
All right, now I want to hear a little bit
Of the drums by himself here
All right, now I want to hear a little bit of
A bass with those eighty-eights
All right, now let's hear the organ player fall in
All right now everybody, I wanna hear you howl
Ah you're cooking, you're smoking
Come on people can you do it?
