Man this real personal to me
This song, that's playing
All I can feel when I hear it man
I just be like
Remember me in the coffee shops
Me in Berkley just walking
Around in the nature
Real peaceful you feel me
Yeah, what you think about me it's Lil B
What you think about moi
Let me tell you like this I
Had a hard time growing up
Didn't know right from wrong
I had to learn myself
I was cool I didn't have many problems
But the people started testing me that's
When I had to shock em
Start to think, is retaliation necessary?
Think about it's all what people think
Don't conform, to social norms
Read books like girls so I stay informed
Don't be on the outside, come on in
We got to work as a people
To move on my friend
Guarantee if you positive
Things move smoother
Don't think, that I'm trying to preach to you
But I gotta keep it real cause I gotta be
Yeah I shop at Ross, yeah Goodwill
Who cares? I don't care what people think
I do me fuck a bitch literally
Literally (laughs) , for real man you're killing me
Don't think too hard man, you're killing me
Don't be missing me, real talk man I got you
Baby baby
Who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
Baby baby
Who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
Think about it, who you got besides family
Most relatives might turn on you
Who you got, on these cold summers
Got to fight for yourself be grateful
No hatin people overseas can't even protest
And we claiming that we in the projects
It's little kids in Iraq
When we ran, most niggas don't got no stress
If you be humble no stress
The humble means you learning
From the progress
Be humble, we grew up in the projects
Be happy that you're dark
Be happy that your skin bright
Be happy that you're alive
Be humble that you're here
Be humble that you hear this music cause
Any day you can lose it
Be humble that you hear this music
Cause any day you can lose it
Baby baby
Who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
Baby baby

Based world based music, based music
Baby baby
Who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
Baby baby
Who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
